## Training and Evaluating Agents on Mobile-Env

### Create an Android Virtual Device

An Android Virtual Device (AVD) running on [Android
Emulator](https://developer.android.com/about) is required to run Mobile-Env.
The AVD can be created through both [Android
Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [Android Commandline
Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio).

##### Create an AVD through Android Studio

Launch the Android Studio after downloading and installing. You will first need
to install the Standard Development Kit (SDK). Open the SDK Manager and enter
Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK sequentially. Here you
can check the installation path of the ADK (Android SDK Location). It is
commonly `~/Android/Sdk`. The desired version can be selected in the list
below. It is recommended to install Android 11 (API Level 30), as it is
observed in the test that, on the `amd64` host devices, the Android 11 emulator
and image offer the best support for the `arm` packages.

![Android SDK Manager](images/android-sdk-manager.png)

Then it is the turn to create an AVD. Open the AVD Manager (or Virtual Device
Manager) and click Create device.

![AVD Manager](images/avd-manager.png)

Then choose an desired AVD hardwareï¼š

![Choose an AVD Hardware Config](images/avd-phone.png)

Subsequently, select a version for the system image. For the same reason,
Android 11 (API Level 30) is recommended. Meanwhile, please choose the version
of Google APIs, but not that of Google Play. This is due to the root privillige
cannot be seized on Google Play images, which is required to solve the problem
of certificate pinning of several Internet-based apps.

![Choose an AVD Image](images/avd-image.png)

Finally, you can name your AVD and make several other configs.

![Config the AVD](images/avd-config.png)

The created AVD can be checked in the AVD list. The AVD folder can also be
opened in the file manager. It is always `~/.android/avd`.

More options are referred to the
[document](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) offered by
Android Studio.

##### Create an AVD through the Commandline Tools

If the Android Studio is undesired, or a headless server is in use, the
Commandline Tools can be adopted to create an AVD.

Download and unzip the Android Commandline Tools.

```sh
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Android/Sdk"
unzip commandlinetools-linux-8512546_latest.zip -d $ANDROID_HOME
```

Then install the emulator, image, and the platform tools by
[`sdkmanager`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager).

```sh
$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=$android_home "emulator" "platform-tools" "platforms;android-30" "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86_64"
```

Then use
[`avdmanager`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/avdmanager) to
create an AVD.

```sh
AVD_NAME="Pixel_2_Test"
avdmanager create avd -n $AVD_NAME -c 8G -k "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86_64" -d pixel_2
```

It is worth noting that there may be a config line in the `avdmanager`-created
AVD. You may need to change the line

```ini
image.sysdir.1 = Sdk/
```

in `~/.android/avd/$AVD_NAME.avd/config.ini` to

```ini
image.sysdir.1 = 
```

Or you can modify the file directly using the following command.

```sh
sed -i.bak -e 's#^\(image\.sysdir\.1[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*\)Sdk/#\1#g' ~/.android/avd/$AVD_NAME.avd/config.ini
```

### Solution of Certificate Pinning of Several Internet-Based Apps

Numbers of Information apps rely on the dynamic contents from the Internet. The
Internet contents vary according to the user's spatiotemporal position, which
will make the training and the evaluation of the agents inconsistent and the
results will be uncomparable. Commonly, we can crawl and store amounts of
online contents of the app to fix it. Then we can replay the stored contents
during training and evaluation through an MitM (Man-in-the-Middle) proxy. Most
apps tranfer their data through HTTPS, thus, the MitM proxy can intercept the
flow and replay the contents correctly only if the app trusts its SSL
certificate. However, several apps adopt a policy named as certificate pinning,
so that the certificates added into the "User Certificate" list in the
operating system (OS) will not be trusted. Three solutions are tested for this
problem and quick config scripts are provided. The details ared referred to
[Solution for Dynamic Information Apps](docs/dynamic-app-en.md).

### Launch the Interaction Environment

```python
import android_env
from android_env.components.tools.easyocr_wrapper import EasyOCRWrapper

env = android_env.load( task_path
                      , avd_name
                      , android_avd_home="~/.android/avd"
                      , android_sdk_root="~/Android/Sdk"
                      , emulator_path="~/Android/Sdk/emulator/emulator"
                      , adb_path="~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb"
                      , run_headless=True
                      , mitm_config=None
                      , start_token_mark=""
                      , non_start_token_mark="##"
                      , special_token_pattern: str = r"\[\w+\]"
                      , unify_vocabulary="vocab.txt"
                      , text_model=EasyOCRWrapper()
                      , icon_model=ResNet()
                      , with_view_hierarchy=False
                      )
```

The parameters are

* `task_path` - `str`. The path to the `textproto` task definition file. A
  folder is acceptable, in which case multiple `textproto` files can be loaded
  once to train the agent in a multitask way. If multiple tasks are being
  loaded, the tasks will be sorted as string according to their file name.
* `avd_name` - `str`. The name of the AVD.
* `android_avd_home``android_sdk_root``emulator_path``adb_path` - `str`. The
  path to several Android tools. The arguments in the example are the default
  values.
* `run_headless` - If the emulator should be launched headless. `True` is for
  headless, which means no graphical window will be created. `False` indicates
  that a graphical window will be available. `False` is the default.
* `mitm_config` - The config for the MitM proxy. If an MitM proxy is in need
  for flow replaying, this parameter should be provided a dict argument, in
      which there are three common fields:
  - `address` - The address the MitM proxy listens to, defaults to `127.0.0.1`.
  - `port` - The port the MitM proxy listens to, defaults to `8080`.
  - `method` - The solution. Three solutions are supported.
    - `syscert` - Mocking the system certificate with the proxy's one
    - `frida` - Replacing the certificate verifier in runtime by the instrument
      tool [Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida).
    - `packpatch` - Modifying the config inside the package to unpin its
      certificate
    The details are presented in [Solution for Dynamic Information
    Apps](docs/dynamic-app-en.md). If `frida` solution is adopted, then three
    extra parameters can be set in the dict:
    - `frida-server` - The path to the frida server on the Android system,
      defaults to `/data/local/tmp/frida-server`.
    - `frida` - The path to the frida client on the host system, defaults to
      `frida`
    - `frida-script` - The path to the frida script on the host system which is
      used to replace the app's certificate verifier, defaults to `frida-script.js`
    `packpatch` will enable an extra parameter as well:
    - `patch-suffix` - This parameter defines a suffix `$suffix`. If the
      package file name defined in the task definition file is `$package.apk`,
      then the platform will seek `$package-$suffix.apk` for the modified
      package file. The prameter defaults to `patched`.
* `start_token_mark` - `str`. The prefix of the beginning tokens in the
  vocabulary. The typed beginning tokens will be separated with the preceding
  texts by a white space. This parameter defaults to the empty string `""`.
* `non_start_token_mark` - `str`. The prefix of the non-beginning tokens in the
  vocabulary. The typed non-beginning tokens are prepended to the existing
  texts directly. This parameter defaults to the prefix of BERT-style
  vocabularies `##`.
* `special_token_pattern` - `str`. The pattern of the special tokens in the
  vocabulary, defauts to `r"\[\w+\]"`, which matches the special tokens in
  BERT-style vocabularies like `[CLS]`.
* `unify_vocabulary` - `Optional[str]`. If a file name is specified, then it
  will be regarded as the vocabulary file, in which each line constitutes a
  token. This file will be loaded as the unified vocabulary for all the loaded
  tasks. If the parameter is unspecified, the small vocabulary defined in the
  task definition file will be adopted, in which case the small vocabulary for
  the different tasks may be different. This parameter defauts to `None`, which
  means "unspecified".
* `text_model` - Text model to enable recognizing the task events such as
  reward, episode end, and step instruction from the screen texts. No valid
  models will be loaded with the default argument.
* `icon_model` - Icon model to enable recognizing the task events such as
  reward, episode end, and step instruction from the screen icons. No valid
  models will be loaded with the default argument.
* `with_view_hierarchy` - If the view hierarchy (VH) should be returned in the
  observation. This option is disabled defaultly for the long latency of VH
  acquisition through ADB.

The text model is supposed to implement two interfaces:

### Interact with the Environment

After loading the environment, you can create an agent to interact with the
environment.

```python
step: dm_env.TimeStep = env.switch_task(0) # switch to task 0
task_description: str = "\n".join(env.command()) # fetch the task description
instruction: str = "\n".join(env.task_instructions()) # fetch the current step instruction

reward: float = step.reward # record the current reward
while not step.last():
    # the agent makes decision
    action: Dict[str, np.ndarray] = agent(task_description, step.observation, instruction)
    # execute the action and obtain the new observation
    step = env.step(action)
    # update the step instruction
    if len(env.task_instructions())>0:
        instruction = "\n".join(env.task_instructions())
    reward += step.reward
```

`dm_env.TimeStep` is defined in [dm_env](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_env).
Commonly, there are 2 properties you will always access:

1. `reward`, a floating number, records the current reward.
2. `observation`, records the current observation.

`dm_env.TimeStep` is equipped with three methods returning a boolean as well:
`first`, `mid`, and `last`. These methods tell the what state in the episode
the agent is.

`observation` is a `dict` object containing four items:

+ `pixels` - The shape is `(H, W, 3)` (height, width, channels). The data type
  (dtype) is `np.uint8` (8-bit unsigned integer). This item stores the RGB
  representation of the screen.
+ `timedelta` - An scalar array of a 64-bit float as the seconds after the last
  `step`.
+ `orientation` - A 4-dim one-hot vector with dtype as 8-bit unsigned interger.
  This item records the orientation of the screen. The positions of the 1 as 0,
  1, 2, and 3 represent that the screen is rotated from the upright clockwise
  by 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees respectively.
+ `view_hierarchy` - This item will be included if the `with_view_hierarchy`
  option is enabled while loading the environment. The value is an
  [`lxml.etree.Element`](https://lxml.de/apidoc/lxml.etree.html#lxml.etree._Element)
  object representing the VH of the current screen. The platform will request
  for the VH only at the initial step and the `LIFT` step owing to the long
      latency. In the other cases, this item will return `None`.

Here the first three items are returned as NumPy arrays.

Mobile-Env accepts a `dict` object as the action containing three item:

+ `action_type` - A NumPy scalar array. The dtype is integer. It is
  corresponding to 4 action types:
  - 0ï¼ˆ`android_env.components.action_type.ActionType.TOUCH`ï¼‰ - The touch
    action.
  - 1ï¼ˆ`android_env.components.action_type.ActionType.LIFT`ï¼‰ - The (finger)
    lifting action.
  - 2ï¼ˆ`android_env.components.action_type.ActionType.REPEAT`ï¼‰ - "Repeat"
    action, *i.e.* doing nothing. This action will keep the previous touching
    or lifting status and inputing no tokens meanwhile.
  - 3ï¼ˆ`android_env.components.action_type.ActionType.TEXT`ï¼‰ - The token input
    action. This action will type a token from the vocabulary. If the
    `unify_vocabulary` parameter is specified while loading the environment,
    then the large vocabulary specified by this parameter is adopted. Otherwise
    the small vocabulary defined by the `vocabulary` field in the definition
    file of the current task will be used.
+ `touch_position` - A NumPy array with the dtype as floating number and length
  as 2. This argument represents the coordinates of the touch position `(x,
  y)`.  The coordinate values should be normalized to `[0, 1]`. This argument
  is required only for the `TOUCH` actions.
+ `input_token` - A NumPy scalar array, The dtype is integer. It is used to
  indicate the index of the token in the vocabulary. The index starts from 0.
  This argument is in need only for the `TEXT` actions

`env.observation_spec` and `env.action_spec` can be invoked to obtain a
declaration of the observation space and the action space. Meanwhile, two
examples using a random policy and a human agent respectively are offered under
`examples` for reference.
