### Main Branch

* âœ“ (Remote environment like OpenAI Universe): Support interaction with
  environment hosted on a remote server. To enable training RL agents on GPU
  servers without KVM enabled.
* (Easier Deployment): Maybe we can construct a docker to simplify the
  deployment of Mobile-Env. Even I feel that it is too complicated to set up an
  Android environment before install Mobile-Env. However, a docker won't help
  KVM configuration, either. Under consideration.
* (VH Node Specification): Using CSS selector to locate a VH node should be
  easier than the current way
* (Repeatability control for event slots): I find it useful to control
  repeatability of an event slot. Will implement it when I have the time.
* (Icon Model): The embedded icon model.

### Annotation Tool Branch

* (About new event source RHU): Update the annotation tool to support the new
  type of event source.

---

### Task Sets

* (OpenMoneyBox): I want to define a group of tasks based on OpenMoneyBox.
